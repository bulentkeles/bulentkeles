      <h5>Project Overview</h5>
      <p>Our project focuses on delivering a digital solution for <a href="https://www.publicbikes.com">Public Bikes</a>, a San Francisco based bicycle retailer. Our goal for this project was to deliver a digital solution that would help Public Bikes sell more of its new line of electric bikes.</p>
      <p>The research and designs below explain the whole process we went through during this project. This project was a General Assembly UX Design Immersive assignment and never published on the web.</p>

      <h5>Team & Duration</h5>
      <p>Given the size of the task we had a rather small team. I teamed up with Melanie Paret who's an expert UX Researcher and Designer. We worked on every aspect of the project together but we both knew our strengths and therefore split our focus areas accordingly. Melanie spent more time on the synthesis of research findings and I was more involved with the design challenges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="grid50">
      <h5>Tools & Methods</h5>
      <p>We used several tools and techniques for the project. We listed research methods we wanted to use in the project including surveys, interviews, journey maps, affinity diagrams, user flows, usability walkthroughs, and contextual inquiries. On the design side we worked with <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a> for wireframes, <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com" target="_blank">InVision</a> for prototypes and <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/" target="_blank">Keynote</a> for the final client presentation.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <span>Public Bikes is a San Francisco based bike retailer that sells a new line of electric bikes. They believe in their product, however they are having difficulty selling them in the US market. Public is looking to understand what they can do on their website to turn this around.</span>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <span>Research clearly showed us we needed to educate customers, and allow them to test the e-bike before even considering a purchase because there was very little knowledge about them.</span>

    <div class="grid80">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <span>We created a product comparison module for new customers unaware of e-bikes. We also built a landing page explaining the benefits of an e-bike. And designed a page with curated test rides where customers could easily pick a route to test the e-bike they could easily relate to.</span>

          <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
          <p>Our initial reaction to solving the problem was to build a mobile app but that thought quickly faded away as soon as we started studying the user. Research showed users didn't want an app, they needed to know about the e-bike and try it out first.
            So we build a website that would help site visitors understand the functionalities and benefits of the e-bike instead of just putting price tags on products. We also created a landing page for customers to learn more from other users' experiences and book a test ride so they could experience the benefits first hand.

          <p>We also designed a mobile responsive web site so that users could easily book a test ride even on the go. The mobile site is mainly focused on converting users into test riding an e-bike while also giving clear access to product categories.</p>
