      <h5>Project Overview</h5>
      <p><a href="https://www.publicbikes.com">Public Bikes</a> is a General Assembly Immersive UX Design Project Patterns For Kids</a>.  The app teaches kids the concept of patterns in a fun and highly interactive way.  The app is built with an algorithm that allows for thousands of pattern variations.  As the learner proceeds through the app the levels become more and more challenging.  </p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Problem</h2>
            <h4>Public Bikes is a San Francisco based bike retailer that sells a new line of electric bikes. They believe in their product, however they are having difficulty selling them in the US market. Public is looking to understand what they can do on their website to turn this around.</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="grid50" style="padding: 20px;">
            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Solution</h2>
            <h4>We created a product comparison module for new customers unaware of e-bikes. We also built a landing page explaining the benefits of an e-bike. And designed a page with curated test rides where customers could easily pick a route to test the e-bike they could easily relate to.</h4>
